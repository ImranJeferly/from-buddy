# Payment System & Webhook Setup Guide

## Overview

This payment system uses external payment links and webhooks to handle subscription management. Users are redirected to your payment provider, and webhooks update their plan status.

## üéØ How It Works

1. **User selects plan** ‚Üí Redirected to `/payment?plan=basic|premium|pro`
2. **Payment page** ‚Üí Shows plan details and redirects to your external payment link
3. **External payment** ‚Üí User completes payment on your payment provider
4. **Webhook notification** ‚Üí Your payment provider sends status to `/api/payment/webhook`
5. **Plan activation** ‚Üí System automatically updates user's plan and quota

## üîó Payment Links Setup

### Update Payment Links
In `/src/app/payment/page.js`, replace the placeholder URLs with your actual payment links:

```javascript
const PAYMENT_LINKS = {
  basic: "https://your-payment-provider.com/basic-plan",      // $9.99/month
  premium: "https://your-payment-provider.com/premium-plan",  // $19.99/month  
  pro: "https://your-payment-provider.com/pro-plan"          // $49.99/month
};
```

### URL Parameters
The system automatically appends user information to your payment links:
```
https://your-payment-link.com?user_id=firebase_uid&email=user@email.com&plan=basic
```

## üì° Webhook Configuration

### Webhook Endpoint
Set up your payment provider to send webhooks to:
```
POST https://yourdomain.com/api/payment/webhook
```

### Required Webhook Events

#### 1. Payment Success
```json
{
  "event": "payment.success",
  "user_id": "firebase_user_id",
  "plan": "basic",
  "payment_id": "ext_payment_123",
  "amount": 9.99,
  "currency": "USD",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

#### 2. Payment Failed
```json
{
  "event": "payment.failed", 
  "user_id": "firebase_user_id",
  "plan": "basic",
  "payment_id": "ext_payment_123",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

#### 3. Subscription Cancelled
```json
{
  "event": "subscription.cancelled",
  "user_id": "firebase_user_id", 
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Webhook Verification (Recommended)
Add webhook signature verification to `/src/app/api/payment/webhook/route.js`:

```javascript
// Add this function to verify webhook authenticity
function verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const crypto = require('crypto');
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');
  
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature, 'hex'),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature, 'hex')
  );
}
```

### Environment Variables
Add webhook secret to your `.env.local`:
```env
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
```

## üìä Plan Quotas & Features

The system automatically sets these quotas based on plan:

| Plan | Monthly Uploads | Features |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Free | 3 (lifetime) | English only, basic features |
| Basic | 15 | All languages, audio support |
| Premium | 100 | All features + advanced AI |
| Pro | Unlimited | All features + API access |

## üé® User Experience Flow

### Success Flow
1. User completes payment ‚Üí Payment provider redirects to `/payment/success`
2. Webhook updates plan ‚Üí User sees confirmation
3. Auto-redirect to profile ‚Üí User can see new plan active

### Failure Flow  
1. Payment fails ‚Üí Payment provider redirects to `/payment/failed`
2. Webhook records failure ‚Üí User sees helpful error message
3. Option to retry ‚Üí User can try again or contact support

## üîÑ Testing Your Integration

### 1. Test Payment Flow
```bash
# Start your development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to pricing section
http://localhost:3000/#pricing

# Click on a paid plan
# Should redirect to /payment?plan=basic

# Test external redirect
# Should redirect to your payment provider
```

### 2. Test Webhook Locally
Use a tool like ngrok to expose your local server:

```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose local server
ngrok http 3000

# Use the ngrok URL for webhook testing
https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/payment/webhook
```

### 3. Test Webhook Payload
Send test webhook with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/payment/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event": "payment.success",
    "user_id": "test_user_id", 
    "plan": "basic",
    "payment_id": "test_payment_123",
    "amount": 9.99,
    "currency": "USD",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }'
```

## üìã Firebase Collections

### Collections Created
- `payment_attempts` - Track payment initiation
- `transactions` - Store payment history  
- `users` - Updated with plan information

### User Document Updates
When payment succeeds, user document gets:
```javascript
{
  planType: "basic|premium|pro",
  planStatus: "active", 
  planStartDate: new Date(),
  planExpiryDate: null,
  uploadQuota: 15|100|Infinity,
  lastUpdated: new Date()
}
```
