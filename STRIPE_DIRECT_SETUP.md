# Stripe Direct Payment Links Setup

## ✅ Current Configuration

Your pricing section now redirects directly to Stripe payment links without intermediate pages:

- **Basic Plan**: `https://buy.stripe.com/test_7sY8wRajdeImbdk0vW0x201`  
- **Pro Plan**: `https://buy.stripe.com/test_dRm14pbnhcAe2GOfqQ0x200`

## 🔧 Required Stripe Configuration

### 1. Update Payment Link Settings

For each payment link in your Stripe Dashboard:

#### Success URL
Set the success URL to:
```
https://yourdomain.com/payment/success
```

#### Cancel URL  
Set the cancel URL to:
```
https://yourdomain.com/payment/failed
```

### 2. Enable Webhook Events

In your Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks, add these events:

```
checkout.session.completed
invoice.payment_succeeded  
invoice.payment_failed
customer.subscription.deleted
```

**Webhook Endpoint**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/payment/webhook`

### 3. User Data Passing

The system automatically appends user data to Stripe links:
```
https://buy.stripe.com/test_xxx?client_reference_id=firebase_uid&customer_email=user@email.com
```

This allows Stripe to:
- ✅ Associate payments with your users
- ✅ Send webhooks with user identification  
- ✅ Pre-fill customer email in checkout

## 🚀 User Flow

1. **User clicks pricing button** → Checks if logged in
2. **If not logged in** → Redirects to `/login`  
3. **If logged in** → Records payment attempt in Firebase
4. **Redirects to Stripe** → User completes payment on Stripe
5. **Payment success** → Stripe redirects to `/payment/success`
6. **Webhook fires** → System automatically upgrades user plan
7. **User sees confirmation** → Auto-redirects to profile after 5 seconds

## 📊 Plan Detection

The webhook automatically detects plan type from payment amount:

| Amount | Plan Assigned |
|--------|---------------|
| $49+ | Pro Plan (Unlimited uploads) |
| $9+ | Basic Plan (15 uploads/month) |
| < $9 | Basic Plan (fallback) |
