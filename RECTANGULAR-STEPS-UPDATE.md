# Rectangular Step Indicator Update

## Changes Made

1. **Modified Step Indicator Shape**
   - Changed from default buttons to more rectangular shape
   - Added rounded corners (border-radius: 8px) for modern appearance
   - Increased the minimum width to 64px to create a more rectangular look
   - Adjusted the height to 38px for better proportions

2. **Enhanced Visual Design**
   - Added distinct styling for active, completed, and pending steps
   - Added a subtle ring effect around the active step button to make it more prominent
   - Used a shadow effect on the active button for depth
   - Adjusted spacing between buttons for better visual rhythm

3. **Technical Improvements**
   - Created dedicated CSS classes in the paginated-form.css file for better maintainability
   - Used custom step-button class to ensure consistent styling across browsers
   - Maintained all existing functionality (scrolling behavior, auto-centering, etc.)

4. **Color Scheme**
   - Active: Blue background with white text and blue ring
   - Completed: Light blue background with dark blue text
   - Pending: Light gray background with gray text

The rectangular step indicators now provide a cleaner navigation interface with better visual affordance, while maintaining all the functionality of the previous implementation.
